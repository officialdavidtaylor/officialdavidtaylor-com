# ingredients

Disclaimer up top: they're a little different every time ðŸ˜‚

The core ingredients are:

- bell peppers
- yellow onion
- egg
- cheese (shredded mexican blend)
- mission burrito tortillas (10-12 inch)
- salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder

Sometimes we throw in:

- sage sausage
- crispy potatoes
- 1/4-1/2 of a habanero, diced very very small

For proportions:

1 red + 1 yellow bell pepper
1 yellow onion
10 eggs (plus a splash of milk)
~2 cups cheese
~8 tortillas

# directions

I think the process might be the most important part in getting the flavor:

1. If you're using sausage, start by browning it in a pan and setting to the side.

(If doing potatoes, you can repeat the same process as the sausage, or more easily bake them -- they ideally end up a little crispy)

2. Leave a couple tbsp of the oil in the pan. Otherwise put a couple tbsp of olive oil in the pan.

3. Chop onion into ~3/16" squares - not diced, but not too big.

4. Chop bell pepper into ~1/4" squares.

5. SautÃ© the onion for ~2-3 minutes over medium heat, adding a few pinches of salt.
   Add the bell pepper, along with garlic powder and paprika. (Add habanero here if you're using it)

6. Once the onion / bell pepper mix starts to get a little stewy, pour the scrambled eggs right over the top; add some cracked black pepper and cook until the eggs are done.

7. For assembly, I like to warm the tortillas first.
   Add a scoop of the egg/veggie mix, some sausage / potato if available, cover it in cheese, then wrap into a burrito.

8. The final step is putting the wrapped tortilla back on the pan / tray used to warm the tortillas, fold side down, so that it turns golden brown, sealing it in the process
